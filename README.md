### Gender Classification Model

This repository contains the source code for a gender classification model that predicts gender based on facial images. The model utilizes computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to categorize individuals into male or female classes.

#### Model Details
- The model employs a combination of feature extraction using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and a machine learning classifier.
- Note that due to missing files (`model2.sav` and `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`), the model cannot be executed directly.
- To use the model effectively, the missing files need to be retrained and provided in the appropriate directories (`/gender-classification-dataset/Model/model2.sav` and `/gender-classification-dataset/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`).
- The training data used to create the missing files can be found in the [Kaggle Gender Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset).

#### How to Use
To utilize the model effectively, follow these steps:
1. **Retraining:** Rebuild the missing model files (`model2.sav` and `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) by training the model with the dataset available in the [Kaggle Gender Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset).
2. **Model Deployment:** Once the missing files are generated, place them in their respective directories to use the gender classification model effectively.

### Gender Classification using OpenCV and HOG

This Python code utilizes OpenCV, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and a pre-trained machine learning model to perform gender classification based on images or a webcam stream. It demonstrates the detection of faces in images or through a webcam feed, extracting features using HOG, and predicting the gender of detected faces.

#### Requirements
- Python
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- joblib

#### Training the Model
To train your own gender classification model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a dataset with labeled images of male and female faces.
2. Use the prepared dataset to train a machine learning model. Below is an example using scikit-learn:

   ```python
   # Example code for training a gender classification model
   # Insert your training code here
   # Save the trained model as 'model2.sav'
   ```

### Gender Classification Dataset

This repository contains a gender classification dataset used for training machine learning models to classify gender based on facial images. The dataset consists of labeled images categorized into male and female classes.

#### Source
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle - Gender Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset). You can find more details about the dataset structure, number of samples, and other relevant information on the Kaggle dataset page.
