### Gender Classification Model

This repository contains source code for a gender classification model based on facial images. The model employs computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify individuals into male or female categories.

#### Model Details
- The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers.
- To retrain the model, run the code in `SVM.ipynb`.
- Training data used to create missing files can be found in the [Gender Classification Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset).

### Libraries Used
To use this command set, ensure you have installed the following libraries:
- `OpenCV`
- `Numpy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `scikit-image`
- `joblib`
- `tkinter` (for GUI components if using the provided command set)

### Testing Interface
- Gender identification of male and female through images and webcam.
