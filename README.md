### Gender Classification using OpenCV and HOG

This Python code utilizes OpenCV, HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients), and a pre-trained machine learning model to perform gender classification based on images or a webcam stream. It demonstrates the detection of faces in images or through a webcam feed, extracting features using HOG, and predicting the gender of detected faces.

#### Requirements
- Python
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-image
- joblib

#### Training the Model
To train your own gender classification model, follow these steps:

1. Prepare a dataset with labeled images of male and female faces.
2. Use the prepared dataset to train a machine learning model. Below is an example using scikit-learn:

   ```python
   # Example code for training a gender classification model
   # Insert your training code here
   # Save the trained model as 'model2.sav'
### Gender Classification Dataset

This repository contains a gender classification dataset used for training machine learning models to classify gender based on facial images. The dataset consists of labeled images categorized into male and female classes.

#### Source
The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle - Gender Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset). You can find more details about the dataset structure, number of samples, and other relevant information on the Kaggle dataset page.
